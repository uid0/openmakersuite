# Project Instructions

## Code Style

- There is a .devcontainer environment for editing and running this application in development mode.
- All changes have to pass pre-commit hooks and the github workflows via the act commands that are present on this system.
- This is for a makerspace -- the default action is open, and while there can be workflows on the admin side of things, consider general requests as unauthenticated unless there is a specific need to either acknowledge or take action on this alert.
- Most calls to actions will be either by wehook push to either discord or integration into slack. Keep that in mind when receiving alerts about supplies being out or areas that may need attention from either the cleaning staff or the logistics/supply team.
- Keep in mind that you may be working in a context local to the developer's machine, or inside the .devcontainer. When writing scripts, assume that the developer's machine is running zsh or bash, and that the .devcontainer runs bash. When running scripts, make sure that you're running inside the devcontainer or on the developer's system.
- The developer does approve some actions manually, so please don't assume that the changes you've asked for are immediately ready for use.

## Architecture

- Follow the repository pattern
- Keep business logic in service layers
- Always provide a reasonable default when creating entries. We want a good out of the box experience for both developers as well as for new users.
- Always write appropriate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using the native language tools and playwright if needed.
- You don't need to create a markdown file for the things that you've done in the repository. Feel free to summarize those changes in the AGENT's file when they would be beneficial for either a human developer, you, or other development agents in the future.
- Always use black, isort, flake8 for python code to make sure that your code is complianct with the tools that we Lint and CI with.

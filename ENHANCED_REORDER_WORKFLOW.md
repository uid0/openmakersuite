# Enhanced Reorder Workflow

## Overview

The reorder workflow has been significantly enhanced to prevent duplicate requests and show expected delivery dates for ordered items. The system now tracks the complete lifecycle of reorder requests and provides better visibility into what's already been requested vs. what still needs attention.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Prevent Duplicate Reorder Requests**
- **QR Code Scanning**: When users scan items that already have pending/approved/ordered requests, they see the existing request status instead of submitting duplicates
- **Smart Detection**: System checks for active reorder requests before allowing new submissions
- **Status Display**: Shows current status, quantity, requester, and expected delivery dates

### 2. **Expected Delivery Date Calculation**
- **Automatic Calculation**: Uses order date + average lead time to calculate expected delivery
- **TV Dashboard Display**: Shows countdown ("Expected in 5 days", "Expected tomorrow", etc.)
- **Visual Indicators**: Different colors and styling for different reorder statuses

### 3. **Enhanced Reorder Status Tracking**
The system now tracks detailed reorder statuses:

- **`well_stocked`**: Item above minimum stock level
- **`needs_order`**: Item below minimum, no active request
- **`pending`**: Reorder request submitted, awaiting admin approval
- **`approved`**: Admin approved, ready to order
- **`ordered`**: Order placed with supplier, tracking delivery

## API Enhancements

### New InventoryItem Fields

```json
{
  "reorder_status": "ordered",
  "has_pending_reorder": true,
  "expected_delivery_date": "2025-11-08",
  "active_reorder_request": {
    "id": 123,
    "status": "ordered",
    "quantity": 25,
    "requested_at": "2025-11-01T10:30:00Z",
    "ordered_at": "2025-11-01T14:00:00Z",
    "requested_by": "John Doe",
    "priority": "normal"
  }
}
```

### New Model Methods

```python
# Backend inventory model enhancements
item.get_active_reorder_request()  # Returns latest pending/approved/ordered request
item.has_pending_reorder()          # Boolean check for active requests
item.get_expected_delivery_date()   # Calculated delivery date
item.reorder_status                 # Status property: needs_order/pending/approved/ordered
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. **Scan Page (QR Code Workflow)**

**Before**: Always submitted new reorder requests, potentially creating duplicates

**After**: 
- Checks for existing requests before submitting
- Shows detailed status for existing requests
- Displays expected delivery dates for ordered items
- Prevents duplicate submissions with informative messages

### 2. **TV Dashboard Display**

**Enhanced Item Cards Show**:
- **Reorder Status**: Color-coded badges (NEEDS REORDER, REORDER REQUESTED, APPROVED FOR ORDER, ORDERED)
- **Expected Delivery**: For ordered items, shows countdown ("Expected in 5 days")
- **Order Details**: Quantity ordered and order date
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Different styling based on urgency and status

## Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: First-Time QR Scan
1. User scans QR code for low-stock item
2. System checks: `has_pending_reorder = false`
3. Auto-submits reorder request
4. Status changes to `pending`
5. TV Dashboard shows "REORDER REQUESTED"

### Scenario 2: Duplicate QR Scan
1. User scans same item again
2. System detects: `has_pending_reorder = true`
3. Shows existing request details instead of creating duplicate
4. Displays status, quantity, requester, and timeline

### Scenario 3: Order Placed
1. Admin approves request and marks as ordered
2. Status changes to `ordered`
3. Expected delivery calculated: `order_date + lead_time`
4. TV Dashboard shows "ORDERED - Expected in X days"

### Scenario 4: Item Delivered
1. Admin marks request as `received`
2. Stock levels updated
3. Item removed from reorder displays
4. Status returns to `well_stocked` if above minimum

## TV Dashboard Status Colors

- ðŸ”´ **Red** (`needs_order`): Item needs reordering, no request submitted
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** (`pending`): Reorder request pending admin approval
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple** (`approved`): Approved for ordering, will be ordered soon
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** (`ordered`): Order placed, tracking delivery

## Benefits

### For Users
- **No Confusion**: Clear status when scanning items multiple times
- **Better Information**: See who requested, when, and expected delivery
- **Reduced Frustration**: No "duplicate request" errors

### For Administrators
- **Cleaner Queue**: No duplicate requests to manage
- **Better Visibility**: See exactly what's been ordered and when it's expected
- **Improved Workflow**: Focus on items that actually need attention

### For the Makerspace
- **Accurate Inventory**: Better tracking of what's on order
- **Cost Control**: Prevent over-ordering due to duplicate requests
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined workflow from request to delivery

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
- Enhanced `InventoryItem` model with reorder status methods
- Updated serializers to include new tracking fields
- Preserved existing API compatibility

### Frontend Changes
- Modified `ScanPage` to check reorder status before submission
- Enhanced `TVDashboard` with delivery date displays
- Added new TypeScript interfaces for reorder tracking
- Improved CSS styling for different status states

### Database Impact
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing `ReorderRequest` relationships
- All new functionality built on current data structure

## Testing

âœ… **Backend Tests**: Model methods work correctly  
âœ… **API Tests**: New fields returned in responses  
âœ… **Frontend Build**: TypeScript compilation successful  
âœ… **Integration**: QR scan workflow prevents duplicates  
âœ… **Display**: TV Dashboard shows enhanced information  

## Usage

1. **Deploy the updates** to your environment
2. **Existing data** will automatically work with new status logic
3. **QR codes** will now prevent duplicate submissions
4. **TV Dashboard** will show enhanced reorder information
5. **No user training required** - workflow is more intuitive

The enhanced workflow provides a much better experience for makerspace users while giving administrators the visibility they need to manage inventory effectively!

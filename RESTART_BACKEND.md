# 🔄 RESTART YOUR BACKEND NOW

## The Issue
Your backend is still running with the **old configuration**. The changes to `settings.py` and `.env` won't take effect until you restart the Django server.

## How to Restart

### Find the Terminal Running the Backend
Look for a terminal/tab where you ran:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Stop the Backend
Press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal to stop it.

### Start the Backend Again
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output like:
```
Django version 4.2.x, using settings 'config.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

## Verify the Changes Took Effect

Once restarted, run this in your browser console again:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/reorders/requests/pending/')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
```

### Expected Result After Restart
✅ HTTP 200 OK  
✅ Data returned (array of pending requests)  
✅ No authentication error  

### Still Getting 401?
If you still get 401 after restarting, run this test:
```bash
./test-all-endpoints.sh
```

This will check if the backend is correctly reading `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=1`.

## Why This Happens
Django loads settings when it starts. Changes to:
- `settings.py` ✅ Need restart
- `.env` file ✅ Need restart
- Python code ✅ Need restart

The auto-reloader only catches some changes, not `.env` changes.

## Current Status
- ✅ `backend/.env` has `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=1`
- ✅ `backend/config/settings.py` has all fixes
- ✅ `backend/reorder_queue/views.py` has permission fixes
- ✅ `backend/inventory/views.py` has permission fixes
- ❌ **Backend needs restart to load these changes!**

## Quick Check
After restarting, you can verify the setting is loaded:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; print(f'DEVELOPMENT_MODE={settings.DEVELOPMENT_MODE}')"
```

Should output:
```
DEVELOPMENT_MODE=True
```

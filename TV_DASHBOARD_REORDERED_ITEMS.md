# Enhanced TV Dashboard - Reordered Items Tracking

## Overview

The TV Dashboard has been completely redesigned to focus on **items that have been reordered** rather than items that need reordering. This provides much better visibility into what's actually in the pipeline and when items are expected to arrive.

## Key Features

- **No Low Stock Clutter**: Only shows items with active reorder requests (pending/approved/ordered)
- **Pipeline Visibility**: Track items from request to delivery
- **Clean Display**: No duplicate or unnecessary information

### üè¢ **Customizable Branding**
- **Organization Logo**: Display your makerspace logo
- **Custom Title**: Default "Dallas Makerspace Inventory" or customize
- **Subtitle Support**: Shows "Items on Order" or custom subtitle
- **Professional Look**: TV-ready branding for public displays

### üìä **Enhanced Status Tracking**
- **Color-Coded Status**: Visual indicators for different reorder states
- **Expected Delivery**: Countdown timers for ordered items
- **Request Details**: Who requested, when, and how much
